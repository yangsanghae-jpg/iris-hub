/**
 * @file Supplementary OpenAPI 3.0 fragments for endpoints that were previously
 * undocumented in the base spec (server/openapi.js). Covers:
 *   - GET  /api/sessions/facets            (Sessions)
 *   - GET  /api/settings/claude-home       (Settings)
 *   - PUT  /api/settings/claude-home       (Settings)
 *   - GET  /api/workflows/runs             (Workflows)
 *   - GET  /api/workflows/runs/{runId}     (Workflows)
 *
 * Exports `{ tags, schemas, paths }` and is combined into the base spec by
 * server/openapi-extra.js. Schema names are prefixed (Sessions / Settings /
 * Workflow) so they never collide with the base `components.schemas`. The
 * Sessions/Settings/Workflows tags are already declared in the base literal, so
 * `tags` here is intentionally empty. Error bodies reference the base-defined
 * `ErrorResponse` (shape `{ error: { code, message } }`); the run-detail agents
 * and events arrays reference the base `Agent` / `DashboardEvent` schemas.
