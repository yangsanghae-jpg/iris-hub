/**
 * @file api.ts
 * @description Defines a set of functions for interacting with the backend API of the agent dashboard application. It includes methods for fetching statistics, managing sessions and agents, retrieving analytics data, handling settings, and managing model pricing. The module abstracts away the details of making HTTP requests and provides a clean interface for the rest of the application to use when communicating with the server.
 *
 * ## What this module is
 * `api.ts` is the single, centralized REST client for the React dashboard. Every page/hook that
 * needs data from the Express backend (`server/`) goes through the {@link api} object exported here
 * rather than calling `fetch` directly. Keeping all HTTP access in one place gives the app a single
 * choke point for authentication, base-path handling, JSON (de)serialization, and error
 * normalization, and it keeps the network surface visible and greppable in one file.
 *
 * ## Layering / where this sits
 * The end-to-end data flow of the product is:
 *
 *   Claude Code hooks -> Express API (`server/`) -> SQLite -> WebSocket broadcast -> React UI.
 *
 * This file covers exactly one hop of that flow: the request/response REST calls the browser makes
 * to the Express API. It is deliberately *not* responsible for real-time updates. Live pushes
 * (new events, status transitions, run output, import progress, etc.) arrive out-of-band over the
 * WebSocket connection and are handled by the `eventBus` / `useWebSocket` layer. A typical page
 * therefore does an initial REST `list`/`get` through this module to hydrate, then listens on the
 * socket for incremental changes. The two mechanisms are complementary; neither replaces the other.
 *
 * ## Conventions shared by (almost) every call
 * - **Base path.** All paths passed to {@link request} are relative to {@link BASE} ("/api"). The
 *   Vite dev server proxies "/api" to the Express port in development, and in production the same
 *   origin serves both the built client and the API, so a relative base works in both modes.
 * - **Auth.** When the operator has locked the server down with a `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, the token is
 *   attached to every request as the `x-dashboard-token` header. In the default zero-config loopback
 *   setup there is no token and the header is omitted. See {@link dashboardToken}.
 * - **JSON in/out.** Requests default to `Content-Type: application/json`; bodies are hand-serialized
 *   with `JSON.stringify` at each call site (so the caller controls the exact shape) and responses
 *   are parsed with `res.json()` and returned as the method's generic `T`.
 * - **Errors.** Non-2xx responses are converted into a thrown `Error` by {@link request}; the message
 *   is the server's structured `error.message` when present, otherwise `HTTP <status>`. Callers get a
 *   rejected promise they can surface in a toast / error boundary; they never see the raw `Response`.
 * - **Pagination.** List endpoints accept `limit`/`offset` and echo them back alongside a `total`.
 *   Transcript reading is the exception: it paginates by JSONL line number (`after`/`before`) because
 *   the underlying file grows live and numeric offsets would drift (see {@link api.sessions.transcript}).
 * - **Timezone bucketing.** Endpoints that group data by day (`stats`, `analytics`, `pricing.cost`)
 *   send the browser's `getTimezoneOffset()` as `tz_offset` so "today" and per-day rollups line up
 *   with the *viewer's* local midnight instead of the server's clock/UTC.
 * - **Query-string building.** Optional filters are assembled with `URLSearchParams` and only appended
 *   when at least one value is present, so a filter-less call hits a clean, cache-friendly URL.
 *
 * ## Two deliberate escapes from {@link request}
 * A couple of operations cannot use the shared JSON wrapper and open-code their own `fetch`:
 *   1. {@link api.import.upload} sends `multipart/form-data` (a `FormData` body), which must *not*
 *      carry the JSON `Content-Type` header, so it calls `fetch` directly.
 *   2. {@link api.settings.exportData} returns a *URL string* rather than performing a fetch, because
 *      the DB export is consumed as an `<a href download>` navigation, not an XHR.
 *
 * ## Shape of the exports
 * The bulk of the module is the {@link api} object: a nested, resource-grouped map of endpoint
 * functions whose grouping mirrors the `server/routes/*.js` file layout (sessions, agents, events,
 * analytics, settings, workflows, pricing, import, cc-config, run, alerts, webhooks). The remainder
 * of the file is the set of exported TypeScript `interface`/`type` declarations describing the
 * request bodies and response payloads that are *specific to this client* (many response DTOs are
 * imported from `./types`; the ones declared here are the client-only ones, e.g. the CC-config
 * explorer shapes, the Run-page process handles, and the import-result shape).

/**
 * Shared fetch wrapper used by every method on {@link api}. Prefixes `path`
 * with {@link BASE} ("/api"), attaches the dashboard auth token (if any) as
 * the `x-dashboard-token` header, and normalizes non-2xx responses into a
 * thrown `Error` whose message is the server's `error.message` (falling back
 * to `HTTP <status>` when the body isn't JSON or has no message).
 *
 * This is the workhorse behind the entire {@link api} surface. Centralizing it
 * here means individual endpoint methods stay one-liners and never repeat auth,
 * header-merging, or error-shaping logic. Two callers intentionally bypass it:
 * the multipart upload ({@link api.import.upload}) and the export-URL builder
 * ({@link api.settings.exportData}) — see the module overview for why.
 *
 * Header precedence (later spreads win): the JSON `Content-Type` default is set
 * first, then the auth token, then any caller-supplied `options.headers` — so a
 * caller can override `Content-Type` if it ever needs to, and per-call headers
 * are merged into (not replaced by) the defaults.
 *
 * @typeParam T   The expected parsed JSON shape of a successful response body.
 * @param path    Path segment appended to `/api` (should start with "/").
 * @param options Standard `fetch` options; `headers` are merged, not replaced.
 * @returns       The parsed JSON response body, typed as `T`.
 * @throws {Error} When the response status is not ok (non-2xx). The thrown
 *   message is `body.error.message` if the error body parsed as JSON and carried
 *   one, otherwise the literal `HTTP <status>`.
